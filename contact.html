                <p class="phar">Life is full of unexpected turns, and sometimes those twists lead us down paths we never anticipated. My journey took an unexpected detour when I broke my leg playing basketball. Suddenly, my mobility was limited, and I found myself searching for new ways to channel my energy and passion.</p>

                    It was during this time of recovery that I discovered a newfound interest in music. With ample time on my hands, I decided to pick up a guitar and explore the world of melodies and harmonies. What began as a simple distraction soon turned into a deep love affair with music. The strings became my voice, and the notes became my language.

                    As I delved further into the world of music, I realized that my fascination with sound and rhythm was closely intertwined with my natural inclination for problem-solving. This realization led me to embark on a new adventureâ€”learning computer languages. With every line of code I wrote, I found a sense of accomplishment and an avenue for creativity that resonated with me.
